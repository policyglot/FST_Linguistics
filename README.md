Use of Finite State Transducers and Deterministic Finite Automata on French data
This is an experimental exploration in applied linguistics that aims to reconstruct full French words from their common abbreviations in SMS-text data. For preliminary testing, we only rely on 12 words. 

In terms of the technical apparatus, each of the consonants represents a state, and the omitted vowel or compound vowels represent paths. Our aim is to identify, in terms of phonology, which particular 'paths' are preferred between which states and uncover any relevant properties based on computational methods.
